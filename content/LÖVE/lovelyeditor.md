IMGUI + LÖVE simple tilemap editor inspired by Tiled. Still WIP.

Current features:
- Loading multiple tilesets
- All UI elements can be ordered as you like
- Multiple layout support, make your own!
- Tab system so you can open multiple editors at once
- Multiple tile selection
- Saving and loading map files from disk
- Tilemaps can be either saved to the map file or referenced via relative path to the project
- Theme system. Make the editor yours!
- Dev: Modular system, new tools can be easily added even without accesing the source code. Just drag your Lua modules into the windows and they get loaded and saved in the global editor data folder.

> [!Warning] Warning!
> Some of the features listed are not fully stable, the editor needs a lot of work and thus it's not public yet. It won't be until the entity and general asset system is implemented. This project is currently on hiatus.
