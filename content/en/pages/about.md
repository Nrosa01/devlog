Hi, I'm Rioni, a game developer and digital artist. I've been always interested in programming, up to the point that I started coding in Java in my `Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro`. I didn't have a computer back then, things that happen when you are a kid. But well, that didn't stop me. I messed around with tasker, custom roms and recoveries and apps similar to app inventor to create my own apps. I also had a tech youtube channel with +2k subs and some videos with +100k views. Don't bother looking for it, it no longer exists. This paragraph is just to say that I love to know how computers work and how to make them do what I want.

And there is my problem, I like MANY things, scripting, graphics programming, game development, web development (just to a certain extent), low level programming, high level programming, language programming... But I know little about most stuff listed there except for game development and scripting. I'm not a master in any of those, but I know enough to make something cool. As many folks in this field, I have lots of unfinished projects, except for those born out of spite, [literally](https://nrosa01.github.io/pmd-quiz-online/).

My main languages are C# and C++, but I also know C, Java, Javascript, Lua, Python, HTML<sup>*</sup>, CSS, GDScript and I've worked with frameworks and libs like Unity, Godot, Svelte, SDL2, OPENGL, IMGUI, Box2D, PhysX... Among others. I also have basic knowledge of Blender.

Wait, Are you stil reading here? This is literally me saying things about myself, well, I'm glad ^^

I don't have much more to say to be honest, so I'll just link my art site. Yes this is a programming blog but it's my blog :)
