title: Welcome to Rioni's site!

Hi there! This is my personal blog in which you can find mainly software related posts. 

I'm both a creative and technical person. I often get distracted trying out new technologies and languages. I like to experiment with different approaches to common or new problems. Because of that, you can find a wide variety of projects here. I haven't included them al because I don't want this page to be enormous.

On the creative side I enjoy drawing, 3d modeling, writing... Although I mainly do drawing as a hobby, it helps me relax and I enjoy it a lot. If you're curious you can check some of my art [here](https://rioni.es)
